# Rust implementation of the Grass Planting Language

This is an implementation of the [Grass Planting Language](http://www.blue.sky.or.jp/grass/ "Grass Planting Language").

It is currently missing File Input (program is hardcoded into the binary) and probably does not adhere to the standard "In" builtin of grass.
