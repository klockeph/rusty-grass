# Rust implementation of the Grass Planting Language

This is an implementation of the [Grass Planting Language](http://www.blue.sky.or.jp/grass/ "Grass Planting Language").

### Usage

Either `cargo run` to see an example (`wWWwwww`; print single 'w') or `cargo run -- filename` to run a grass file.

### Warnings/Errors

Rusty-Grass does probably not adhere to the standard "In" builtin of grass.
